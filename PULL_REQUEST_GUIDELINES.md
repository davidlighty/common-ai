# Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for creating clear and effective Pull Requests. Well-crafted PRs facilitate smoother reviews and faster integration of changes.

## PR Title / Header

*   **Be Descriptive:** The title should clearly and concisely summarize the purpose of the PR.
*   **Reference Issues (if applicable):** If the PR addresses a specific issue, include the issue number (e.g., "Fix #123: User login bug").
*   **Use a Conventional Prefix (Optional but Recommended):** Consider prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:` to indicate the nature of the change. (e.g., `feat: Add user profile page`).

## PR Summary / Description

*   **Use Bullet Points:** Present the summary of changes as a bulleted list. This makes it easy to scan and understand the key modifications.
*   **Keep it Short and Focused:** Each bullet point should be concise. Focus on *what* was changed and *why*.
*   **Emoji Use is Okay üëç:** Emojis can be used to add clarity or visual cues where appropriate, but don't overdo it.
*   **No Footers:** The PR description should not include boilerplate footers unless they serve a very specific, agreed-upon purpose (which is generally discouraged here). The focus should be on the content of the change.

## Key Information to Include

*   **Purpose of the Change:** Briefly explain why this PR is necessary. What problem does it solve? What feature does it add?
*   **Summary of Changes:** Use bullet points to list the main modifications.
    *   Example:
        *   ‚ú® Added a new endpoint for user data.
        *   üêõ Fixed a bug in the calculation logic.
        *   üìÑ Updated the README with new instructions.
*   **How to Test (if applicable):** Provide clear steps for reviewers to test the changes.
*   **Screenshots/GIFs (for UI changes):** If the PR involves UI changes, include visual aids to demonstrate the before and after.
*   **Related Issues/PRs:** Link to any related issues or other PRs.

## Review Process

*   **Self-Review First:** Before requesting a review, review your own PR thoroughly. Check for typos, debugging code, and adherence to these guidelines.
*   **Request Specific Reviewers:** If you know who should review your code, assign them.
*   **Respond to Feedback:** Address comments and feedback promptly and constructively.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure our Pull Requests are informative and contribute to an efficient development workflow.
