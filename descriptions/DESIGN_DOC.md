# Design Document Guidelines

This document outlines the best practices and expected structure for creating design documents.

## Core Principles

-   **Clarity:** The document should be easy to understand for all stakeholders, including those who may not have deep technical knowledge of the specific area.
-   **Conciseness:** Be thorough but avoid unnecessary jargon or overly lengthy explanations. Get to the point.
-   **Completeness:** Ensure all critical aspects of the design are covered.
-   **Rationale:** Clearly explain *why* decisions were made, not just *what* the decisions are. Document alternatives considered and why they were not chosen.
-   **Actionability:** The document should provide enough detail for relevant teams to act upon it.

## Standard Sections

While the specific sections may vary based on the project, a good design document generally includes:

1.  **Title:** Clear and descriptive.
2.  **Author(s) & Date:** Who wrote it and when.
3.  **Version History:** Track changes and revisions.
4.  **Introduction / Overview:**
    *   Briefly describe the problem or opportunity.
    *   State the purpose of this document.
5.  **Problem Statement:**
    *   Clearly define the problem this design aims to solve.
    *   Explain the impact of the problem (e.g., user pain points, business impact).
6.  **Goals and Objectives:**
    *   What are the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for this design?
    *   What are the key success metrics?
7.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope):**
    *   Clearly state what this design does *not* aim to address. This helps manage expectations.
8.  **Proposed Solution / Design:**
    *   This is the core of the document.
    *   Describe the proposed solution in detail.
    *   Use diagrams, flowcharts, or mockups where appropriate.
    *   Break down complex systems into manageable components.
    *   Discuss technical details, architecture, data models, user interfaces, etc.
9.  **Detailed Design (if applicable for sub-components):**
    *   More in-depth explanations of specific parts of the solution.
10. **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   List other solutions or approaches that were considered.
    *   Briefly explain why each alternative was not chosen.
11. **Impact Assessment:**
    *   Consider the impact on other systems, teams, security, performance, cost, and users.
12. **Rollout Plan / Implementation Strategy (if applicable):**
    *   How will this design be implemented and deployed?
    *   Phased approach? Milestones?
13. **Open Questions / Future Considerations:**
    *   List any unresolved issues or areas that require further investigation.
    *   Note potential future enhancements or related work.
14. **Glossary (if needed):**
    *   Define any terms or acronyms that might not be widely understood.

## Review Process

-   Specify who needs to review and approve the design document.
-   Outline the feedback and iteration process.

*Refer to this document when creating new design proposals to ensure consistency and completeness.*
