# Code Quality Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for writing high-quality code. The overarching goal is to produce code that is clean, understandable, maintainable, and efficient.

## Core Principles

1.  **Readability:** Code is read far more often than it is written. Prioritize clarity and simplicity.
2.  **Self-Documenting Code:** Strive to write code that is so clear in its intent and structure that it requires minimal explanatory comments.
    *   Use meaningful variable and function names.
    *   Employ clear and consistent naming conventions.
    *   Break down complex logic into smaller, well-named functions or methods.
    *   Ensure a logical flow and structure within files and modules.
3.  **Maintainability:** Write code that is easy to modify, debug, and extend.
    *   Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
    *   Keep functions and classes focused on a single responsibility (SRP - Single Responsibility Principle).
    *   Ensure modules and components are loosely coupled.
4.  **Correctness & Robustness:** Ensure the code behaves as expected and handles errors gracefully.
    *   Write comprehensive tests (unit, integration, etc.).
    *   Implement proper error handling and validation.
    *   Consider edge cases and potential failure points.
5.  **Efficiency:** Write code that performs well and uses resources judiciously, but not at the expense of clarity if the performance gain is negligible.

## Commenting Best Practices

*   **Minimize Comments:** Comments are not a substitute for clear, self-documenting code.
*   **Comment *Why*, Not *What*:**
    *   Avoid comments that merely restate what the code is doing if the code itself is clear.
        *   Bad: `// Increment i by 1` followed by `i++;`
    *   Use comments to explain complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or the reasoning behind a particular approach, especially if it involves trade-offs or workarounds.
*   **Keep Comments Up-to-Date:** Outdated comments are worse than no comments. If you change the code, ensure any related comments are also updated or removed.
*   **Avoid Clutter:** Do not leave commented-out blocks of old code. Use version control (e.g., Git) to track history.
*   **Use for TODOs (Sparingly):** If you must leave a task for later, use a consistent format like `// TODO: [Explain what needs to be done]` or `// FIXME: [Explain the issue]`. These should be addressed promptly.
*   **API Documentation:** For public APIs, libraries, or complex functions, use structured documentation comments (e.g., Javadoc, TSDoc, Python docstrings) to explain parameters, return values, and usage. This is distinct from inline implementation comments.

## Naming Conventions

*   Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of variables, functions, classes, etc.
*   Be consistent with the conventions of the language and project (e.g., `camelCase`, `PascalCase`, `snake_case`).
*   Avoid overly short or cryptic names (e.g., `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`) unless they are conventional for very small scopes (like loop counters).

## Code Structure & Formatting

*   Maintain a consistent coding style (indentation, spacing, line breaks). Use linters and formatters to enforce this automatically.
*   Keep functions and methods short and focused on a single task.
*   Organize code into logical modules or files.
*   Limit line length to improve readability.

## Testing

*   Write unit tests for individual components.
*   Write integration tests to ensure components work together.
*   Aim for good test coverage, focusing on critical paths and edge cases.
*   Tests serve as a form of documentation and help prevent regressions.

## Version Control (Git)

*   Make small, atomic commits with clear and descriptive messages.
*   Use branches for new features and bug fixes.
*   Regularly pull changes from the main branch to avoid large merge conflicts.

By following these guidelines, we can build a codebase that is easier to work with, more reliable, and adaptable to future changes.
