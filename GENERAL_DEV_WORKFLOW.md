# General Software Development Workflow

This document outlines a generalized workflow for software development projects, adaptable for various application types. It's derived from best practices and a comprehensive task list for a specific game project but has been generalized for broader applicability.

**Note for AI-Driven Development:** When development tasks are performed by an AI agent, the `frameworks/AI_CODING_FRAMEWORK.md` document MUST be consulted and its principles strictly adhered to throughout all phases of this workflow. Specific references to relevant sections of the AI Coding Framework are included below.
